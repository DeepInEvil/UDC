Maybe I should try writing the file to a disc at a slower speed? __eou__ __eot__ maybe, I guess anything goes at this stage, I have my share of bad luck in the past with installs, and I learned that it reaaly depends on *excactly* where the install gets stuck to know - what's causing it. __eou__ __eot__ and getting stuck after making the partition and copying files isn't one you're used too? :P __eou__ __eot__ also, I'm not sure if ubuntu keeps an install log anywhere, that would have been a dead giveaway to your problem. __eou__ well, yes, happend, it was bad Media. __eou__ __eot__ I'll just try writing the disc at a slower rate I guess. It's still stuck on that screen so I'll reset, reformat, and try to reinstall. __eou__ __eot__ sucks that you use Windows, if you have a machine that you can try and use this media on, you could see if the media is bad. __eou__ also, if you're going the ""bad media"" router, did you verify the MD5 on this download ? __eou__ route=router __eou__ __eot__ ",I didn't verify unfortunately but I figured getting a torrent right from the ubuntu DL page I wouldn't need too >.< __eou__,serial printer baby :) __eou__,my pleasure :) __eou__,just checking :) __eou__,I  grabbed the 3.0 driver as well.

Hi there. I just did a fresh install of 12.04 (64-bit) and I'm having issues getting my GTX 550 ti graphics adapter to work. It worked fine in 10.04. I've tried searching google but I can't find anything relevant. It works when I switch the main adapter to onboard in bios and use the onboard adapter. What do you need to be able to help me get the graphics card working? __eou__ __eot__ is that some kind of optimus setup (switching Graphic Adapters on the fly) ? __eou__ __eot__ ,No. I disabled the PCI-E adapter in bios and am using the onboard adapter. __eou__,"Yeah, maybe I'll just reinstate xorg.conf... __eou__",that you do in the terminal settings __eou__,I doubt it would be memory or file system. I can reinstall 10.04 and everything is fine.
