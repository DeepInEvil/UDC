hello. I'm running hoary on a pentium laptop with kernel 2.6.10-5-386. I wish to compile a custom kernel module I wrote. However the kernel sources I have are only for 2.6.10 which is leading to a module load time error about the version of symbol struct_module. Could someone help me decipher this one or point me to the right forum ? __eou__ __eot__ grab linux-headers-2.6.10-5-386 __eou__ __eot__ : Ok. I'll give that a shot. __eou__ : I still wonder how that would help. In the 2.6 series, one is expected to use the 2.6 sources and build system for compiling modules. In that case, how do I build my module against the 2.6.10-5 headers ? __eou__ __eot__ the headers have the needed version info __eou__ __eot__ : Yes but in ubuntu the 2.6.10 sources are installed seperately and the 2.6.10-5 headers are installed seperately. If I want to use 2.6 kernel source and build system like `make -C /path/to/kernel/source M=/path/to/dir/containing/my/module/and/makefile modules` it won't work with seperate headers, right ? __eou__ __eot__ 	I wouldn't think you'd need the kernel source installed, usually just the headers to build a module __eou__	1.0

Hi everyone. __eou__ Does anyone have a reccomendation for a live CD that's useful to rescue borked windows machines? I'm going to be taking on a bit of tech support overflow from a friend, and want to be prepared for weird cases. __eou__ Awesome suggestions everyone. I'll have some fun researching. __eou__ __eot__ ubcd has a live linux cd called insert, it has a bunch of good tools __eou__ disarm??? it's ok, i get called that alot ;-) __eou__ the advantage to irssi is you don't have to be running linux to use it, just ssh from any os that has an ssh client (carry putty on a usb stick) __eou__ __eot__ That sounds pretty nice.  I learned the power and wonderfulness of SSH last week when my wife and I were setting up the webserver at the school district I teach at.  Now our webserver runs Ubuntu. *le grin* __eou__ __eot__ isn't funny how what you use at home ends up being what infiltrates your workplace and friends houses ;-) __eou__ __eot__ Yeah, that's true. In this case, our district tech director is moving on to another job, and wanted me to be in charge of the webserver, so I got to put what I wanted. Debian Woody was a little old to run the Mambo site my wife is developing, so on Ubuntu went! __eou__ __eot__ is gimpshop different than gimp, or just a name? __eou__ __eot__ It's a config-hacked Gimp, to make it work more like Photoshop.. menus, etc. __eou__ __eot__ 	all the packages will be different versions... __eou__	0.0

hmmm i have been installing ubuntu for about an hour now and the screen  turned black with one underscore just sitting at the top left of the screen, is this supposed to happen? __eou__ __eot__ Install shouldn't take a whole hour.. at least.. I think not. __eou__ __eot__ but it is just sitting there, can't hear it writting data any more, should I reboot __eou__ __eot__ Yeah, you might need to.  Did you burn the CD you're installing from? __eou__ Did you burn it at the highest speed your burner can use? I had issues with burning install discs at high speed. Causing errors I think. __eou__ __eot__ not sure burned at default speed __eou__ __eot__ Hmmm. If you restart the install, and hit escape while it's asking you questions about your setup, you'll get a menu. You can scroll down, and near the bottom, there'll be a menu item for testing the install disc. It'll check to see if the disc is error-free. __eou__ That was the only problem I had with installing Ubuntu.. I had errors on the disc, so I made sure to burn the disc sloooww.  2x or 3x.  That seemed to fix it. __eou__ No problem. :)  I hope that that solves your issue. Welcome to Ubuntu! __eou__ __eot__ if there is a problem will it just stop at one point at the disc and keep spinning and sound like its aobut to overheat? __eou__ __eot__ I'm honestly not sure. But it seemign to totally freeze is a pretty good sign that something went wrong. :( __eou__ __eot__ sorry to bother ya again, just scanned it and it said the cd was fine...? __eou__ __eot__ Well, if it said that, and it freezes on install at the same point every time, you'll have to find someone more knowledgable than me. One thing I did to verify that my burned copy was good was to rip an ISO image off of the disc... take an md5 sum of that ISO, and compare to the MD5 of the iso I'd burned from.  If they matched, the burn was absolutely perfect. __eou__ __eot__ will do ty __eou__ __eot__ Sorry that it's been an ordeal. It was for me too, but when I finally got it installed.. I never looked back, and I totally switched to Ubuntu from Windows. :) __eou__ That's odd. There shouldn't be a root user in Ubuntu.

Xchat simply fails to register me before joining #ubuntu, so I always end up in #ubuntu-unregged. __eou__ __eot__ we can't move people from one channel to the other... __eou__ __eot__ you move me from #ubuntu, to #ubuntu-unregged, (or at least you redirect me there) __eou__ __eot__ setting auto-rejoin works, during these kick-sprees I set the channel on invite only and a redirect to #ubuntu :) __eou__ __eot__ 	in any case, i've fixed it on my side, so it should be fine. __eou__	1.0

hi all. Just done a new install of ubuntu from a hoary cd, I'm having a problem with it finishing the installation, it can't seem to finish doing the final step, it has issues with scroll keeper restarts dgm and then does an apt-get upgrade and again fails with scroll keeper, I left it going all  night and it has just been stuck in that loop __eou__ I was hoping someone would be able to give me an idea as to why this might be happening __eou__ __eot__ are yo usure the CD burnt correctly? __eou__ __eot__ I haven't MD5 checksumed it, but everything till the end seemed to work without a problem, I have changed the source.list to match the one i haev on my home installation hoping that would solve the issue but it doesnt. No matter wether i use my home one or the default one it seems to keep back things like gzip and bzip2 and then gives me scroll keeper errors __eou__ __eot__ 	no i cant because im not a developer. all i know is that networking works like ass with certain routers7modems and isps __eou__	0.0
