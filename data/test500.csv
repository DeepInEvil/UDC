"There is a router between the webserver and the internet, right? __eou__ __eot__ We dont know. __eou__ __eot__ Sorry, wrong nic __eou__ __eot__ The subnet mask /24 or 255.255.255.0 tells you that your network range is from 192.166.1.0 to .255 whereas .0 is the network address and .255 is the broadcast address. __eou__ Thats a static lease, but not a static IP. __eou__ __eot__ Yea, well, same difference. __eou__ Ok, yes you are correct.  But, essentially the PC gets a static IP (either way). __eou__ It's just a matter of terms. __eou__ __eot__ No. Using a static lease, the PC gets a DHCP IP which is always the same ;) __eou__ __eot__ If it is always the same it is ""static"" (as opposed to ""dynamic""). __eou__ __eot__ As long as it is served by the _D_HCP server, it isnt a static IP. __eou__ __eot__ Anyway, it doesnt matter, but you are correct, it is refered to (in router configs) as ""static lease"". __eou__ __eot__ A DHCP cant assign static IPs, but only static leases. __eou__ __eot__ Ok, I get your point, (but the fact remains that if the IP address does not change, it is ""static"", (by definition of the word ""static""). __eou__ __eot__ static refers to the lease, not to the IP. __eou__ __eot__ I told you once already, ""You are correct, it is refered to as a ""static lease"". __eou__ You are more than likely correct.
